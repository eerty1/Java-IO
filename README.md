# Java-IO

So we moved to the next step which is Java-IO. 	:thread:

This moment i didn't know what is threads, but it is another story. :exploding_head:

This module is just IO. :expressionless:

Quite interesting and easy. :four_leaf_clover:

I learned how to transfer data to files, console and other entities.

In a conclusion of the course, I had 1 major main task and several optionals.

The requirements of the main task will be given below and optional tasks as usual - are provided in EPAM repository (the link is in "other"). :eye:

The number after "Optional Task" indicates the task number from the backup

## Requirements of the task

Implement a program that will receive the path to the directory as a command-line argument, for example "D:/movies ". 

Write the structure of folders and files to a text file in a form similar to the execution of the tree/F program. Example:

If the path to the txt file is passed to the program as a parameter, not the path to the director - read the file and output the following data to the console:

* Number of folders

* Number of files

* Average number of files in a folder

* The average length of the file name

## Installation

Since it is pure Java, you needn't any complicated actions. :trophy:

You are proposed to use Java 8.

There're the steps to unpack my project: 

* git clone Java-IO

* Open it via your IDE

## Usage

There're no any peculiarities.

As I said before, just open it in your IDE and build the project.

Don't forget to change the paths to the files

## Other
 
All the materials were taken from the [EPAM Automated Testing course](https://training.epam.com/#!/Training/3044?lang=en). :test_tube:

The backup of the tasks could be found [there](https://github.com/vitalliuss/automation-training.git), in file "backup.md". :file_folder:

Unfortunately they provided only RU verion of the requirements.
